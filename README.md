# React Todo Application

This is a simple Todo application built using React.js that allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks. It also provides the functionality to filter tasks by completion status.


## Features

- Display a list of existing tasks, showing the task name and its status (completed or not).
- Add new tasks with validation to prevent empty task names.
- Mark tasks as completed or active by clicking on them.
- Edit task names by clicking on an edit button.
- Delete tasks from the list.
- Filter tasks by "All," "Completed," or "Active" status.
